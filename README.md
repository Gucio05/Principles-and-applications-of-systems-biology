# Project in Principles-and-applications-of-systems-biology

Goal: recreate figures 3-6 produduced by the authors of the article 'Improving the phenotype predictions of a yeast genome-scale metabolic model by incorporating enzymatic constraints'. (https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20167411)

Method: Use GECKO, a model developed by the authors, and apply the content learned in the exercise sessions

## Installation of GECKO

Github of the GECKO mentioned in the paper:
- Gecko v1.0 (https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/GECKO/releases/tag/v1.0)
  - README file of the installed source code indicates to install **SBML** (https://sbml.org/software/libsbml/libsbml-docs/installation/)
    - run installSBML.m in matlab to install SBML
   
Installing steps of the required packages for GECKO
  1) Gurobi
    - Register @ Gurobi
    - install and run, restart computer
  2) RAVEN
    - 
  3) ..
